Welcome! I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, Center for the Study of Contemporary China and will be an assistant professor at NYU Shanghai beginning in the Fall of 2022. I received my Ph.D. in political science from the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on local government accountability and transparency in China. 

Please find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nkxcizdig70o3by/Kim.Jieun_CV.pdf?dl=0). You can reach me at kimjieun@sas.upenn.edu.
