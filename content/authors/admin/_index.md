Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I study local government accountability and transparency with a focus on Chinese politics. My dissertation, *Local Government Accountability in China: The Center, Local Networks, and the Courts*, examines how various political actors strengthen or weaken local government accountability in China. 

My research has been supported by the Center for Chinese Studies (CCS), Center for the Study of Law and Society, and Institute for International Studies (IIS) at UC Berkeley, and the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS). 

Please find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nkxcizdig70o3by/Kim.Jieun_CV.pdf?dl=0). You can reach me at kimjieun@berkeley.edu.
