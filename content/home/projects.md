My dissertation, \textit{Local Government Accountability in China: The Center, Local Networks, and the Courts}, examines how various political actors strengthen or weaken local government accountability in China. The first chapter focuses on the central government’s role in crafting policy guidelines that shape local governments’ incentives for implementation. I bring attention to the central leaders’ frequent use of ambiguous policy guidelines during decentralized policy experimentation and explain why. My theory incorporates contrasting perspectives on the function of ambiguous guidelines—namely, giving flexibility versus creating uncertainty. Using a formal model, I argue that ambiguity induces only “competent” local agents, or those who can generate a successful outcome, to initiate a “gray-area policy” at some risk, while discouraging the less competent ones from doing so. I illustrate the model with an explanation of state-owned enterprise reform in China, using qualitative evidence. 

The second chapter of my dissertation studies bottom-up forces in China, devoting attention to one substantive policy area, the Open Government Information (OGI) initiative. I examine how city leaders’ embeddedness in local networks, assessed based on their career trajectory, affects their implementation of government transparency. My main finding is that embedded leaders (“insiders”) perform worse on proactively disclosing government information but perform better on responding to citizens’ information disclosure requests, compared to non-embedded leaders (“outsiders”). I argue that while embedded leaders might not bother proactively to disclose information that would embarrass local influentials, they still endeavor to fulfill disclosure requirements upon requests, in part owing to their affinity to the local population. I rely on an original dataset of prefectural-level cities’ annual OGI reports between 2008 and 2016 as well as interviews with government officials and policy experts from five months of fieldwork in China.  

In the third chapter of my three-article dissertation, which is still at a fairly early stage, I turn to horizontal dynamics between local governments and the courts. I attempt to evaluate the efficacy of a jurisdiction reform involving the courts, in particular, centralizing jurisdiction of administrative litigation cases, and how it affects OGI-related litigation. This reform aims to curb local government interference in administrative litigation cases by assigning cases to non-local, centralized courts. Using a difference-in-differences design, I plan to examine how the reform affects courts’ tendency to rule in favor of governments.
